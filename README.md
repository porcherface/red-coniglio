red coniglio is a horrendously ugly version of a funny minigame called bianconiglio.
However, red coniglio is also a player! this little fluffy bot will try to solve bianconiglio levels with little to no
human aid!

what is bianconiglio? bianconiglio is a small game developed by 42 Roma Luiss created to test a person's confidence with simple programming loops. red coniglio reads the bianconiglio level setup and elaborates an optimized solution. the optimization is performed using a simulated annealing algorithm (coded in C and embedded into a python3 application), while the GUI is developed using AppJar, a python3 module to create user interfaces (sorry folks, i wasn't aware of pygame when i developed this project, i will migrate this to pygame when i have the time)
